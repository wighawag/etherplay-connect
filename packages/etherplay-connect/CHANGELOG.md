# @etherplay/connect

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 7d71662: Add `storagePrefix` so several connections in one page keep separate persisted state.

  A page can legitimately run more than one connection: a player connection (hosted sign-in, `targetStep: 'SignedIn'`) plus a separate payment connection (`targetStep: 'WalletConnected'`, `autoConnect: false`) so whoever pays need not be the account the player signed in as. Until now both wrote the same two module-level keys, `__origin_account` and `__last_wallet`, in both `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`, so they silently overwrote and deleted each other's state: connecting the payment wallet made the player connection auto-reconnect as the payer on the next page load, `disconnect()` on either connection wiped the other's stored identity, and `cancel()` wiped the other's last-wallet hint.

  `storagePrefix` is available on every `createConnection` overload and namespaces both keys in both storages, so the effective keys are `${storagePrefix}__origin_account` and `${storagePrefix}__last_wallet`. It defaults to `''`, which keeps the keys byte-identical for existing single-connection apps: no migration, no lost sessions. `disconnect()` and `cancel()` now only clear their own connection's namespace, which falls out of the prefixing.

  What `doNotStoreLocally` covers is unchanged: it still gates saving the origin account and nothing else. `saveLastWallet` stays unconditional on purpose, since remembering the last wallet is wanted for every connection, including the payment one, and namespaced it no longer collides.

### Patch Changes

- e75e69a: Deduplicate EIP-6963 wallet announcements so several connections in one page are safe.

  EIP-6963 discovery is page-wide. Unless a `walletConnector` is passed in, each `createConnection` builds its own connector, which attaches an `eip6963:announceProvider` listener and dispatches `eip6963:requestProvider`. Two connections constructed close together overlap in that window: the second one's request makes every installed wallet announce itself again while the first is still listening, and the first appended the repeat. With exactly one wallet installed, `connection.wallets` ended up with two entries for the same `info.uuid`, which took the `wallets.length > 1` branch and stopped the flow at a `WalletToChoose` picker listing that wallet twice, with the entry button degraded from "Connect \<WalletName\>" to "Connect a Wallet".

  Announcements are now deduplicated on `info.uuid`, falling back to `info.rdns` for wallets that regenerate their uuid. This is done where the list is built in `@etherplay/connect`, so it holds for any connector, and also inside `createWalletFetcher` in `@etherplay/wallet-connector-ethereum`, so the connector never records the same wallet twice either. Creating any number of connections is safe by default, with no need to share an `EthereumWalletConnector` between them.

  Unchanged, and still a known limitation: the Ethereum connector stops listening for announcements 100 ms after construction, so a wallet that announces later is not listed.

## 0.1.4

### Patch Changes

- 3b80f88: Document and pin down the SSR / construction-inertness contract. `createConnection(...)` is now a tested, guaranteed property: it constructs in any environment (bare Node, no DOM) without throwing, touching `window`/`document`/`localStorage`/`sessionStorage`, scheduling timers, or doing network I/O, and off-browser the store rests at `{step: 'Idle', loading: true, wallets: []}` — identical to the browser's first render so hydration does not mismatch. Added a `node`-environment regression test (`test/ssr-inert.test.ts`) covering both `targetStep: 'WalletConnected'` and `targetStep: 'SignedIn'` configurations, and documented the contract (including that `loading: true` and the initial store shape are a hydration-visible breaking change, and that `provider.request(...)` intentionally performs a real RPC request off-browser) in the README. No runtime behaviour changed.

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- 54f3d05: Reset the always-on provider wrapper when a connection attempt fails, so read-only RPC calls (eth_call, eth_blockNumber, etc.) fall back to the JSON-RPC endpoint instead of being routed through the failed wallet provider.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- d1ec11c: Distinguish EIP-1193 error codes (4100/4001) in connect failure and add clearError to store API

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 60a51f3: Fix a dead end after a rejected wallet prompt in wallet-only mode.

  In wallet-only mode (`walletOnly: true`, or `targetStep: 'WalletConnected'`) the mechanism picker is never shown, because `connect` always defaults the mechanism to `{type: 'wallet'}`. The wallet failure handlers still rested on `MechanismToChoose`, a step such an app has no reason to render, so a rejected wallet prompt left the user with nothing on screen and no way to retry or cancel. `ensureConnected` only ever initiated from `Idle`, so the next call neither prompted the wallet nor settled: it hung silently.

  Two changes:

  - A failed attempt now rests on the step that offers the user a real next decision: `MechanismToChoose` when the app is multi-mechanism, `WalletToChoose` when the app is wallet-only and several wallets are detected, and `Idle` when it is wallet-only with a single (or no) wallet. The `error` is kept in every case so the UI can explain the failure. This rule now covers all three wallet failure paths, which is also what makes them consistent with the auto-connect paths that already reset to `Idle`.
  - `ensureConnected` now also initiates from a picker step that still carries the `error` of a previous failed attempt, so a retry prompts again instead of waiting forever. It still refuses to initiate from a picker step without an error, since that means the user is mid-choice and connecting would hijack it. The new `{forceConnect: true}` option opts into initiating from a resting step regardless. Rejection on a fresh error is now checked before the return-to-`Idle` cancellation, so a wallet-only failure that rests on `Idle` still rejects with the real cause (and `code === 4001` for a user rejection) rather than a generic `Connection cancelled`.

  Downstream cleanup: the `MechanismToChoose`/`WalletToChoose` -> `connection.back('Idle')` workaround in `mandalas` (`web/src/lib/ui/purchaseFlow.ts`) can be deleted once this is released, and `_ensureConnected` reduced to `ensureConnected` plus a catch.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- ccb8bdc: Add the Same-Origin Callback Bridge (domain-redirect fallback) for the OAuth-redirection flow.

  When a popup-based OAuth login severs the `window.opener` relationship (due to COOP headers or cross-scheme redirects), the popup can no longer reach the parent via `postMessage` or a same-origin `BroadcastChannel`. This adds a robust, 100% client-side fallback: the popup redirects one final time to a static bridge page (`_etherplay_accounts.html`) served on the parent's own origin, which delivers the result via `window.opener.postMessage` (often re-established once same-origin) or `BroadcastChannel`.

  - `@etherplay/connect-core`: new zero-dependency Web Crypto helpers (ECDH P-256 + AES-GCM) used to encrypt the credential exchange that transits the URL hash fragment.
  - `@etherplay/connect`: new opt-in `domainRedirectBridge` config flag on `createConnection`. When enabled, the SDK generates an ephemeral ECDH keypair, threads its public key through the redirect chain, and decrypts the result on either transport (window `message` or `BroadcastChannel`). Delivery is opportunistic: the direct opener path is used when the link survives, the encrypted bridge only as a fallback.
  - `@etherplay/openfort`: the `domain-redirect-public-key` param is now carried through the Openfort `redirectTo` URL so it survives the full-page OAuth round-trip.

  Integrators opting in must host `_etherplay_accounts.html` at `/_etherplay_accounts.html` on their app's origin. When the bridge is disabled (the default), behavior is unchanged.

### Patch Changes

- d54e1d6: Fix `ensureConnected` never settling when a connection attempt fails.

  When the user rejected the wallet prompt (EIP-1193 code 4001), the store went `Idle -> WaitingForWalletConnection -> MechanismToChoose` with an `error` set. `ensureConnected` only rejected when the store returned to `Idle`, so the returned promise neither resolved nor rejected and every `await` on it hung forever, leaving downstream UI wedged with no error to react to.

  `ensureConnected` now rejects with a `ConnectionFailure` when an attempt ends without reaching the target step:

  - a fresh `error` appearing in the store (one that was not already there when `ensureConnected` was called) rejects with that error's `message`, and propagates the underlying wallet error as both `cause` and a convenience `code`, so callers can tell a user rejection (`code === 4001`) from a genuine failure,
  - an attempt that falls back to a resting step (`Idle`, `MechanismToChoose`, `WalletToChoose`) after having started rejects with `Connection cancelled`.

  Being at a resting step is never a failure by itself: `ensureConnected` is routinely called while the picker is showing (including with a stale error banner from a previous attempt), and those calls still wait for the user's choice and resolve normally.

  New export: `ConnectionFailure` (an `Error` subclass with `cause` and `code`).

  Downstream cleanup: the `_ensureConnected` workaround in `mandalas` (`web/src/lib/ui/purchaseFlow.ts`), which races `ensureConnected` against the store returning to a resting step, can be deleted once this is released; its call sites can simply catch the rejection. `template-onchain-app` awaits `ensureConnected` too and was exposed to the same hang.
